# quant-spark
Quantitative Analysis Toolkit on Spark/Scala

This project was completed in 2015 as part of an MS in Computer Science. It explores the use of Spark and Scala for
building a quantitative analysis system that can be used for large datasets - such as minute-by-minute stock data across
the complete US equity market, and across many years of history.

The attached paper describes the problem space (active portfolio management), the design and what was built as proof-of-concept.
I have also described additional R&D that could be performed to continue to expand the system and to solve for other types of
financial analysis problems.

Feel free to experiment and use the project, for insights or to extend it further.
